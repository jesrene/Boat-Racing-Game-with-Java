# Boat Racing Game with Java
The game involves two players and starts with each player receiving a boat. Throughout the game, the players alternate turns to roll a dice, determining the number of steps their boat advances. The game's playing area resembles a track with 100 columns, representing the river. This river track contains varying quantities of traps(#) and currents (c).

In the file TopScore.txt, the scores are organized in ascending order, and corresponding player names are positioned above their respective scores. The scores correspond to the number of turns each player takes to complete the game.
